The way to change the world is to change the way people perceive the world. The ability of geospatial technology to change peoples' perceptions is extremely powerful. My interests lie at the intersection of geospatial literacy, technology and the application of that knowledge to solve -not just study- the complex challenges society faces today. 

I am an experienced program manager with over 10 years of GIS experience. I work at the University of Arizona Library where I provide GIS support to students and faculty. 

Prior to pivoting to full-time GIS work, I managed over $150 million in grant funds at the state and local level including bond funds, FEMA HMGP & PA and HUD CDBG grants for capital construction projects - transportation infrastructure, public facilities and homeowner buy outs, and home repair.
