## About

I am an experienced program manager with over 10 years of GIS experience. I work at the University of Arizona Library where I provide GIS support to students and faculty.

Prior to pivoting to full-time GIS work, I managed over $150 million in grant funds at the state and local level including bond funds, FEMA HMGP & PA and HUD CDBG grants for capital construction projects - transportation infrastructure, public facilities and homeowner buy outs, and home repair.
