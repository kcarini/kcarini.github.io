## State of the Map US 2022 Conference
I submitted a bid to host State of the Map US at the University of Arizona in Fall 2019, and we were selected as the location for the 10th Anniversary State of the Map. Due to COVID, our plans for an in-person conference were put on hold, until we began planning in earnest again in Fall 2021. I participated in weekly planning calls with a team of other OpenStreetMap US staff and volunteers. Planning the conference was a significant team effort and I took on many of the local Tucson responsibilities such as Library & Student Union venue coordination, local promotion & marketing efforts on campus and regionally, aided in the social event planning, secured a keynote speaker and recruited UArizona conference volunteers.
